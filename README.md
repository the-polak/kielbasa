## MacOS Scripts
[/mac-sh/](https://github.com/the-polak/kielbasa/tree/main/mac-sh)

A few mac pro models apps such as chromium based browsers or Obsidian misbehave resulting in glitches, crashes and much pain. Disabling GPU support allows apps to run fairly well. See this [issue](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1145). 

`electron-patcher.py` is a much [cleaner alternative](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1145#issuecomment-2282958031) to multiple scripts.
